**Learn to implement complex data structures and algorithms using Python**

## What is this book about?
Data structures allow you to store and organize data efficiently. They are critical to any problem, provide a complete solution, and act like reusable code. Hands-On Data Structures and Algorithms with Python teaches you the essential Python data structures and the most common algorithms for building easy and maintainable applications.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Understand object representation, attribute binding, and data encapsulation 
* Gain a solid understanding of Python data structures using algorithms 
* Study algorithms using examples with pictorial representation 
* Learn complex algorithms through easy explanation, implementing Python 
* Build sophisticated and efficient data applications in Python 
* Understand common programming algorithms used in Python data science 
* Write efficient and robust code in Python 3.7

## Errata
* Page 105: Fourth line in the first code block must be read as "self.head = None" instead of "self.tail = None".
* Page 108: Fifth line in the first code block must be read as "self.size -= 1" instead of "self.count -= 1".

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
class Node: 
    def __init__(self, data=None): 
        self.data = data 
        self.next = None
```
